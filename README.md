## **Aim**
This project is about designing of compact solar panels which can be used on any 
terrain for maximum energy generation per unit area.

## **Introduction**
In this age of advancement, humanity is trying to shrink every other object to
 the smallest achievable state. We decided to shrink solar panel systems to
 their least folded state. Using the ancient Japanese art of Origami, these models can shrinked down to 10 times of the original size.

 Designing such systems is a challenge, but we've succesfully designed some of 
 the prospective ones while rejecting the others on the basis of our own 
 Criteria Of Selection.

## **Criteria Of Selection**
- It should be compact
- Ease of Manufacturing
- No requirements for specially shaped solar panels for a particular model
- More power generation per unit area
- Less stress-strain variation while folding
- Cost Effective

> On the basis of the criteria of selection we have shortlisted certain models, which have then been crtitqued according to the criteria.

## **Shortlisted Models**
- Iso-area flasher 
- Herringbone Tessellation
- Miura Ori Tessellation
- Miura Ori (Sharp Angle) Tessellation

### **A.Rejected Models**
- Iso-area flasher 
- Herringbone Tessellation
- Miura Ori Tessellation

>These models have been rejected because they havenâ€™t followed the mentioned criteria for selection.

#### **1. Iso-Area Flasher**

This is one of the most compact models we've come across. It is folding a considerable array of square solar 
panels down to a cube of the dimensions equivalent to a single cube. This model is quite compelling. However, it 
failed one of the primary aims of this project, **"Cost-Effectiveness"**. Building this model will require 
specially manufactured solar panel systems of varying shapes and sizes. Due to the folding patterns' complexity 
and the high-stress generation, while folding, this model was rejected.

#### **2. Herringbone Tessellation**
Another potential candidate for the model. This one was, however rejected 
because of the complexity of the structure. Just like its counterpart Iso-Area 
Flasher, this one too has sharp foldings and angles, which are tedious to 
achieve from a folding system of solar panels. More shadow area when light is 
thrown at it from a particular angle, hence making it not feasible to use at 
certain angles.

#### **3. Miura Ori Tessellation**
Another suitable candidate, bearing much resemblance to our final model, the 
Miura Ori Tessellation, followed almost all the criteria of requirement. 
However, this model is fatally rigged with structural flaws. While folding the 
given model, a sharp increase in stress was observed along the joints and the 
point of connections. This model is not viable for longevity as it can suffer 
from a mechanical faliure at any point in time.

### **B. Preferred Model**

**Miura Ori (Sharp Angle) Tessellation**
Lastly, The preferred Model, Miura Ori (Sharp Angle) Tessellation, is the model 
we have selected. It checks all the criteria needed for the perfect composite 
system. It is easy to design, very compact, easy to manufacture and develops 
almost negligible amount of stress while folding. A 24 by 12 tessellation can 
generate nearly 24 times the power generated in its folded state. This makes it 
the perfect candidate for our objective.


## **Conclusion**

Thus from the extensive analysis we were able to find the best possible and the preffered model for the solar pannel systems. It can be easily implemented  on any terrain by the army and can be even used in cube-sats.
